*(FIXED) Since the one on github didn't work. (ALSO INCLUDES .DLL SO YOU CAN JUST INJECT INTO FORTNITE)* 

## Setup 

### Dependencies

*https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35*

### Installation

* Mac OS X
* Ubuntu & Linux

### Getting started

*You must have DirectX, Visual Studio 2019, and Your favorate .DLL injector installed*

*as well as Fortnite OBVIOUSLY to make this work.*

`Open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2019`

`Build as x64 RELEASE and build the .DLL`

`Open your favorate DLL Injector`

`Inject built DLL into Fortnite-Win-Shipping.exe`

## Usage

*Make sure you are at the Main Menu of Fortnite before injecting.*
*Load the .DLL file you have built into any DLL Injector (I recommend using UNDETECTED Injectors for this).*
*The IMGUI should open up with ESP options, etc...*
